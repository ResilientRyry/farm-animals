# farm-animals
Who had a farm? Me after I created this web application.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JQuery

Created a web application that made a noise and moved the matching animal that the user clicked on.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create a function that made a image move to a random location on the dom and I also learned how to make a sound after being clicked. This was my first time attaching sounds to a click event.
